# Rules

- Uses standard 52 card deck. At the beginning of each match the deck is shuffled and divded evenly (26 cards each) amongst two players.

- Each player puts their first card on the table (face up), and whoever's card has the higher value takes both cards. This process repeats until a draw (equal cards) occurs.

- In this scenario, "war" breaks out: both players must put down one card (face down), and the next card face up. Whoever's face up card has the higher value takes all 6 cards.

- If another draw occurs with the face up cards, the process repeats until a winner is decided.

- The game is won when one player has all 52 cards.

- As a user i want to be able to be able to receive half a deck of cards at the beginning of the game (randomized), so that i can play against my opponent.

- As a user i want to be able to reveal the top card of my deck and have my opponent do the same.

- As a user i want to compare my card with my opponents card to see who has the higher value, so that the winner can take both cards and repeat the process.

- As a user i want a feature in place for when war (a draw) happens, so that a winner can be decided.

- As a user i want the ability to play my last card face up if it is my last card during a war match.
